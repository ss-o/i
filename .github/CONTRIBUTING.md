# Introduction

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
   2.1 Ensure the test suite passes.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ss-o/i/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ss-o/i/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Try to be specific.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Readable code is easy to follow, optimizes space and time. Here are a few tips to achieve that:

- Write as few lines as possible.
- Use appropriate naming conventions.
- Segment blocks of code in the same section into paragraphs.
- Use indentation to marks the beginning and end of control structures. Clearly specify the code between them.
- Use the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle. Automate repetitive tasks whenever necessary. The same piece of code should not be repeated in the script.
- Avoid Deep Nesting. Too many nesting levels make code harder to read and follow.
- Avoid long lines. It is easier for humans to read blocks of lines that are horizontally short and vertically long.
